Using import module  we selectively load  the required modules 
// for this particular example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to
// include all of the modules in your application.js file instead.


--> import {sum} from "./math.js"
---> export the function
export const add = (a, b) => sum(a, b);
in package.json add -->  "type": "module",


IMPORTANT --> loading Synchronous for "require" and Asynchronous for "import"

In Node.js, there are two ways to load JavaScript files: synchronously using require()
